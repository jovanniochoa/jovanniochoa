### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am currently working on making a website. Originally started as a website resume, but I am going to host projects on this website later on. Projects such as Helium Cryptocurrency map and logging, stuff like crypto analyses. I will eventually make a login. I will then make so many different features.
What I am doing right now:
Getting API's and making sure I am doing BEST Practice by restricting API calls to my domain... Now all I worry about is spoofing, so I am making a "Man On The Side" to make an server-proxy so I can safely store my API keps without them being displayed publicly.
